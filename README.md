# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis was to display gathered UFO sighting data as a table on an HTML webpage. We also used JavaScript to create filters by which users of the webpage can filter the table to find specific UFO sightings that match the user inputs. Finally, we used CSS and Bootstrap functionality to help create visualizations and stylistic formatting for the webpage.
